Photo Book
----------

This is a personal project I started in 2007 to generate a yearly photo book 
(as a 5x7" PDF) which I have printed by Viovio http://viovio.com/ for my family.

I described my motivation for the project here:

Since then I've used the code to generate annual photo books:
2008: http://justinsomnia.org/2009/01/the-2008-photo-book/
2009: http://justinsomnia.org/2010/01/the-2009-photo-book/
2010: http://justinsomnia.org/2011/09/the-2010-photo-book/
2011: http://justinsomnia.org/2012/01/the-2011-photo-book/

In 2009 I significantly rewrote the layout code to add gutters and increase 
"safety" margins per Viovio's PDF specs: http://www.viovio.com/wiki/PDF+Specs

I'm hosting the code on GitHub for illustrative purposes only. Many of the 
layout details are hardcoded, which suit my purposes just fine, but probably 
won't suit yours without significant modification.
